**REQUIRED TO RUN OUR APPLICATION - UPDATE FOLIUM FILE**
1) Download the folium file from this repository 

2) Locate the folium folder that was initially downloaded

3) Repalce your folium folder with the folium folder that you have just installed from this repository

4) If all were done correctly, there should not be any error running the application. Thanks
